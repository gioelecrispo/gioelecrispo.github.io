The depth camera of the Kinect Sensor is used to carry out Depth \nSegmentation and reduce face detection false positives. In addition, a confirmation \nwindow is used to stabilize the model's predictions.\n\nThe model used is a CNN built from scratch and trained on FER 2013 Dataset. Then, an \noptimization phase has been performed to obtain the best hyperparameters.\nThe following <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOJncJAVPng\">video</a> shows \nthe results of our work.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; width: 100%\">\n<iframe style=\"max-width:650px; height:auto;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kOJncJAVPng\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen>\n</iframe>\n\n<br></br>\n\n</div>\n\n\n## The study case: Face and Emotion recognition with a CNN\nIn this section, we describe the step we followed to train the face recognition and emotion \nrecognition models and use them on a video stream capture from a Camera / Kinect.\n\n### Face Detection and Recognition: Dataset acquisition\nTo train face recognition we created a script that allowed us to collect images of a\nperson's faces. The script must be configured by passing as parameters the name and the\nnumber of photos to be saved. The process uses opencv's face detector to automatically\nextract faces and save them by labeling with the name entered.\nThis also allowed us to quickly review the saved photos and delete dirty data if any.\nTo have good recognition performance we used about 100 photos per person; results clearly\nvary in different lighting conditions.\n\n### Face Detection and Recognition: Train and evaluation\nThe training of opencv's LBPHFaceRecognizer is very quick. We trained it on two different\nfaces, but it's scalable on multiple faces.\n\nFor the inference phase we used the labels extracted from the LBPHFaceRecognizer of\nopencv trained as described in the previous point to create **Confirmation Windows** for\neach person and then isolate the emotions based on the detected face.\nMore details on the Confirmation Windows will be given later.\n\n### Emotions Recognition: Data Exploration and Processing\nWe used FER2013 dataset. As a first step, we analyzed the dataset to verify its \ndistribution and check its content, displaying some images.\n\nWe noticed that it is a very difficult dataset, since it has 3 main issues:\n1. It is very **unbalanced**, as shown in Fig. 1;\n2. The images it contains are **dirty** (some images are cartoons) or have noise (for \n   example writing or hands on the face). Refer to images contoured by red and blue rectangles in Fig. 2; \n3. Some **images could be misclassified** (e.g. some emotion tagged as \"fear\" could be \n   classified as \"surprise\"). Refer to images contoured by green rectangles in Fig. 2.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/dMWP6QX/data-distribution.png\" alt=\"distribution\" width=\"80%\"/> \n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Fig. 1.

Some examples of images belonging to \"Angry\" emotion.\nThe red rectangle indicates an image taken from a cartoon. The blue rectangles are around images soiled by writing.\nFinally, it is difficult to say if the woman in the green rectangle on the right is angry or shocked; the emotion of the man on the second row on the right could be considered also \"Happy\".</i></a></span>\n<br>\n</div>\n\n<br>\n<br/>\n\nIn fact, as mentioned in [this paper (sec. III)](http://cs230.stanford.edu/projects_winter_2020/reports/32610274.pdf), \nthe human accuracy on this dataset is about 65%.\n\nThe dataset is already divided into train, validation and test and we made sure that the \nthree sets had the same distribution.\nWe then decided to merge the train and validation sets together, in order to be free \nin choosing the percentage to be allocated to the validation set.\n\nFinally, we decided not to use oversampling techniques and to use the as-is dataset, \nto try to get the most out of the CNN network and the training process, without adding \nnew data.\n\n### Emotions Recognition: Training and Evaluation\nWe used a CNN built from scratch, consisting of four convolution layers and two dense \nlayers. We verified that the model was sufficiently powerful and we managed overfitting \nwith regularization techniques such as l2 and dropout.\n\nThe dataset has been divided into 70% for training, 20% for validation and 10% for testing, \nrespectively. In the training phase, we used Keras' `ImageDataGenerator` utilities \nto do some data augmentation and add zoomed and horizontally mirrored images. \nThis allowed us to increase the test performance a bit.\n\nWe have optimized the hyperparameters of the model through the use of `Optuna`; \ndetails on hyperparameters and ranges will be given later.\n\nIn the evaluation phase, we plotted a normalized confusion matrix to understand the\nperformance of the model relative to each class. The results were what we expected: a\nstrong polarization towards the most populous classes and an average error spread across\nall them. In fact, the performance mirrors the challenges of the dataset.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/L6M3SkQ/evaluate.png\" alt=\"evaluate\" width=\"80%\"/> \n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Fig. 3. Confusion matrix after the optimization phase.</i></a></span>\n<br>\n</div>\n\n\n### Improvements for real use\nGiven the poor performance of the model and considered the fact that the images acquired \nby a webcam may be \"different\" from those present in the dataset, we decided to add some \n\"improvements\" for real use.\nWe first introduced a **Confirmation Window**, to stabilize the model predictions over \na higher frame number.\nThe confirmation window, implemented as a queue, collects the emotions of the last 20 \nframes and returns the value only if the dominant emotion is present in more than 60% \nof the frames. If this condition is not satisfied, \"Neutral\" is returned, indicating \nthat the model is not fully convinced of the emotions collected in the last 20 frames.\n\nA confirmation window is associated for each recognized person, so as not to mix \npredictions related to different faces.\n**The benefit this implementation has brought is that the feeling that the model \nis wrong has drastically reduced**.\n\n## Building Freenect and the python wrapper\nThe code can run also on a generic camera, but we used the Kinect to take advantage of \nthe depth sensor to decrease false positives.\nWe built its drivers on Mac OS, based on the Homebrew method described at the following \nlink: [https://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started#OS_X](https://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started#OS_X). \nWith Homebrew you can easily install the Kinect v1 drivers.\n\nKinect's depth camera helped us to segment and filter objects based on depth. \nThis allows us to reduce the number of false positives of face detection. \nSince there is no rejection threshold for face recognition, limiting false positives \nalso allows the predictions contained in the confirmation window to be \"not dirty\", \nthus resulting in a reliable prediction.\n\n<br/>\n\n## Do not forgive Optimization\nAfter deciding that the chosen model had performances in line with what was expected, \nwe moved on to the optimization phase, to obtain better hyperparameters and therefore a \nhigher accuracy.\nWe used optuna, an optimization framework specifically designed for this task.\n\nThe hyperparameters we have optimized are:\n```python\n   'lr': learning rate, uniform distribution from 1e-5 to 1e-1,\n   'decay': lr decay, uniform distribution from 1e-7 to 1e-4,\n   'dropout': uniform distribution from 0.10 to 0.50,\n   'l2': l2 regularization in Conv2D layers, uniform distribution from 0.01 to 0.05,\n   'kernel_size': for Conv2D layers in range [3, 5],\n   'batch_size': in range [16, 32, 64, 128],\n```\nThe best hyperparameters, found in 50 iterations, are:\n```python\n   'lr': 6.454516989719096e-05,\n   'decay': 4.461966074951546e-05,\n   'dropout': 0.3106791934814161,\n   'l2': 0.04370766874155845,\n   'kernel_size': 2,\n   'batch_size': 32,\n```\n\nwith a test loss of: `1.0534`, and test accuracy of: `66.035%`.\nThe optimization phase added a few percentage points to the average accuracy; however we \ncan affirm that the perceived performances are much higher. The advice we give is \ntherefore not to forget the optimization phase; 4-5 percentage points are not many and do \nnot upset the performance of a poor-performing model, but they can still make a difference.\n\n<br/>\n\n## Prepare for production with ONNX\nTo speed up the inference phase, we setup up the ONNX conversion and runtime tools.\nAfter choosing the best hyperparameters for the emotion model, we trained it and got \nan optimized Keras model.\nSo we converted it to a ONNX model.\nGenerally speaking, the ONNX model version is much faster than the Keras one.\nThis leads a less power consumption and a higher FPS for our video application.\nOn our machines (CPU based, no NVIDIA), the ONNX model is around 25x faster than keras \nversion.\n\nThese are the results:\n```\nKeras predictor 100 times  -  Elapsed: 3.177694320678711; mean: 0.03177694320678711\nONNX predictor  100 times  -  Elapsed: 0.119029283523559; mean: 0.00119029283523559\nFactor: 26.696.\n```\n```\nKeras predictor 10000 times  -  Elapsed: 317.5036771297455; mean: 0.03175036771297455\nONNX predictor  10000 times  -  Elapsed:  11.5271108150482; mean: 0.00115271108150482\nFactor: 27.544.\n```\n\n<br/>\n\n## Conclusions\nAlthough the recognition of faces and emotions is not a new topic, it was interesting \nto approach a challenging dataset, applying all the best practices that are used to \nbring a solution into production.\nThe task was difficult mainly due to the implications of using a very unbalanced, \nvery heterogeneous dataset with few samples. We did a statistical analysis, but \ndecided not to oversample and treat the dataset as it was.\nIn order not to make things easier for us, we have decided not to do transfer \nlearning from a pre-trained model. \n\nThe optimization phase was fundamental to obtain \nan accuracy of approximately 5% more. Although, accuracy is not perfectly indicative \nof such an unbalanced dataset, the model's perceived performance after optimization \nwas much more satisfactory.\nThe use of **confirmation windows also made a big difference**; they are not a new \ntechnique, but they help tremendously in correcting false positives and increasing \nperceived performance.\nFinally, the use of **ONNX** was important to achieve a performance boost on \nthe CPU and make the application usable in real time, reaching an average of 30 frames \nprocessed per second on discrete computers.\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/a-complete-ml-pipeline-study-case-face-and-emotion-recognition","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2022-04-17T15:05:11.484Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1650208034322},"$loki":1},{"slug":"a-novel-writing-order-recovery-approach-for-handwriting-specimens","description":"A pattern-recognition based approach for recovering the writing order trajectory of a signature is shown.","title":"<span>A novel <strong>Writing Order Recovery</strong> approach for handwriting specimens</span>","author":"Gioele Crispo","img":"a-novel-writing-order-recovery-approach-for-handwriting-specimens.png","alt":"wor-talk","tags":["pattern-recognition"],"createdAt":"2019-03-16T12:15:20.516Z","toc":[{"id":"introduction","depth":2,"text":"Introduction"},{"id":"why-writing-order-recovery","depth":2,"text":"Why Writing Order Recovery?"},{"id":"the-idea","depth":2,"text":"The idea"},{"id":"point-classification","depth":3,"text":"Point Classification"},{"id":"local-examination","depth":3,"text":"Local Examination"},{"id":"global-reconstruction","depth":3,"text":"Global reconstruction"},{"id":"results","depth":2,"text":"Results"},{"id":"conclusions","depth":2,"text":"Conclusions"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"a-novel-writing-order-recovery-approach-for-handwriting-specimens"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#a-novel-writing-order-recovery-approach-for-handwriting-specimens","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"A novel Writing Order Recovery approach for handwriting specimens"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Introduction"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Why "},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"writing order recovery"}]},{"type":"text","value":"?"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The idea"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Results"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Conclusions"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"introduction"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#introduction","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Introduction"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This post summarizes the work and ideas behind my thesis work, which became a publication at the "},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"16th\nInternational Conference on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition"}]},{"type":"text","value":" (ICFHR) at "},{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Niagara Falls"}]},{"type":"text","value":", USA, in August 2018\n("},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327405064_Tracking_the_Ballistic_Trajectory_in_Complex_and_Long_Handwritten_Signatures"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"see here"}]},{"type":"text","value":"),\nand another journal article is in the works."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The following "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYJawbV0Y2k&t=58s"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"video"}]},{"type":"text","value":" shows the results of my work."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"div","props":{"style":"text-align:center;

Now, if the signature is digitally acquired (**online writing**), \nwe have access to a lot of information, as it is possible to record all the movements that the writer makes. \nIf the signature has been acquired analogically (**offline writing**), i.e. on paper using a pen, the task becomes \nextremely difficult. Nowadays, most signatures are still done without digital devices.\n \nTechniques have therefore been born that allow us to infer the writing dynamics \nthrough pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms. By «*writing dynamics*» we mean all information \nrelated to speed, pressure, writing tracing order, etc.\nAll this information is essential to carry out a more accurate signature verification and at the same time the technique \ncan be used in other fields such as handwriting recognition and so on.\n\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319443706_Recovering_Western_On-line_Signatures_From_Image-Based_Specimens\">article</a>, \nthe authors (Moises Diaz, Miguel A. Ferrer, Antonio Parziale and Angelo Marcelli) proposed a framework for \nobtaining the dynamics of a handwriting stroke starting from a static image.\nThe **Writing Order Recovery (WOR)** is positioned as the second step of this framework and its goal is to infer the \nwriting order. Among all, the writing order is the most informative and preparatory element for estimating \nthe other dynamic components such as speed and acceleration. I have decided to concentrate on this delicate \nstep and reapproach the problem by providing a new point of view and a new way of solving it \n(<a href=\"https://github.com/gioelecrispo/wor\">here the code</a>).\n\n## The idea\nAs expressed by the framework mentioned above, the first step for Writing Order Recovery is to perform a \nthinning on the image, in order to have a track composed of only one pixel. In fact, the image acquired with\nthe pen is a dirty, double trace, and reconstructing the writing order is more difficult.\n\nThe class of algorithms used to produce this thin trace is called **skeletonization**. \n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/y4t7B1z/skeletonization.png\" alt=\"skeletonization\" width=\"100%\"/> \n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Fig.1. Comparison between the the Real Image (a), the binary one (b) and the skeletonized one (c). Image from <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319443706_Recovering_Western_On-line_Signatures_From_Image-Based_Specimens\"><i>\nRecovering Western On-line Signatures FromImage-Based Specimens</i></a></span>\n\n<br>\n\n</div>\n\nWhat I noticed right away is that, whatever the method used, skeletonization produces artifacts and non-existent lines that \nbreak down the performance of the algorithms of the subsequent steps. This observation is almost *trivial*: \nsince no information on dynamics is available, even for skeletonization it is difficult to produce quality results.\nFor this reason, I decided to apply the ideal skeletonization, the best possible, obtainable through the **Bresenham \nalgorithm**. \nThis algorithm produces a thin track by exploiting the dynamics with which it was performed. It is the perfect \nbasis for developing a good Writing Order Recovery algorithm.\n\nLet's enter in the interesting part.\nThe Writing Order Recovery algorithm I proposed consists of 3 parts: \n1. **Point classification** \n2. **Local Examination** \n3. **Global Reconstruction**.\n \n<br>\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/SmPySCQ/algorithm.png\" alt=\"algorithm\" width=\"70%\"/>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Fig. 2. Phases of which the algorithm is composed.</span>\n\n<br>\n\n</div>\n\n### Point Classification\nThe **Point Classification** phase deals with analyzing the thinned signature pixel by pixel. \nPixels are classified according to their neighbors: if a pixel has only one other neighbor pixel it is considered \nan *end point*; if a pixel has two neighbors it is considered a *trace point* and if it has 3 or more it is \ndefined as a *branch point*. Agglomerations of branch points form a cluster of points. \nThe innovation is here: clusters are the \"hard part\" and this is where I have concentrated my efforts.\n\nIn the literature we rarely speak of \"agglomerated points\". This is because we usually work on imperfect \nskeletonization algorithms, which never produce lines thicker than 1 pixel, in order to simplify the work of \nwriting order recognition: however, there is a huge loss of information.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0nTtvW8.png\" alt=\"algorithm\" width=\"65%\"/>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Fig. 3. Point classification. It depends on the number of neighboring pixels for each pixel.</span>\n\n<br>\n\n</div>\n\n### Local Examination\nThe **Local Examination** phase focuses on the analysis of branch point clusters. Among them there are some \nparticular points: \nthose in contact with a trace point are called *anchor branch points* and overlook an outgoing branch from the \ncluster (see the Fig. 4). Indeed, a cluster can be seen as the intersection point of multiple lines. \nThe goal is therefore to \nunderstand how to match the outgoing cluster branches and correctly reconstruct the paths that the writer's \npen has performed.\n\nTo understand how to couple these output branches, we calculate the internal angles of the cluster, the \nexternal angles, we perform a prediction of their direction through multiscale analysis algorithms and \nfinally we calculate the matching through pattern-recognition algorithms. To make the article streamlined and easier \nto follow, I leave out the details you find in the paper <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327405064_Tracking_the_Ballistic_Trajectory_in_Complex_and_Long_Handwritten_Signatures\">at this link</a>.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/U2hzrMG.png\" alt=\"algorithm\" width=\"75%\"/>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Fig. 4. Cluster analysis. In this phase we search for anchor branch points and we compute the angles to find the \ncluster output branches associations.</span>\n\n<br>\n\n</div>\n\nOnce we have rebuilt a cluster, i.e. associated its exit branches, we know how a track enters and exits \nthe cluster. So we can reconstruct the signature.\n\nHowever, a writer can make several strokes, lifting the pen from the sheet multiple times.\nAnother task of writing order recovery is to correctly identify the so-called *components*. A **component** is \ntherefore a stroke of writing performed without ever lifting the pen from the sheet. Identifying them is not easy.\nIn general, we use end points, i.e. those points that have only one neighbor, so it is reasonable to think that \nthe stroke started from there.\nAnyway, this approach is not enough; with the information obtained from the clusters we can better infer when \na writer stops his pen or when he continues.\n\n### Global reconstruction \n\nOnce the cluster have been rebuilt and the components have been individuated, we can proceed with the\n**Global Reconstruction** of the signature. \nThis means trying to infer the writing direction of each single component (for example from left to right or\ntop to bottom, etc) and the order of the components, then understand in which order they were traced by the writer.\n\nThis is by no means a simple task. Without information about the current signature, we can only guess using\nheuristics or predictive algorithms trained on other data. However, every writer has their own writing method, \nso there is no 100% reliable solution.\nThe heuristics I used were basically two:\n1. for the first component, start from the top left corner, assuming that most writers write from left to right;\n2. for the following components, choose the closest one according to the Euclidean distance. \n\n<br>\n\nBelow, an image that clarify what are the components (indicated by different color) for each signature and \nhow they were traced by our algorithm (shown by the arrows).\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/u7pvRp4.png\" alt=\"results\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Fig. 5. Global reconstruction. We find all the components \n(indicated by different colors) in the signature and then we trace them.</span>\n\n<br>\n\n</div>\n\n\n## Results\nThe method proposed above was performed on two datasets, SUSIG-Visual and SigComp2009, \ndemonstrating the independence of the algorithm from the dataset and from the writing method of each writer.\n\nTo evaluate the goodness of the method, we used the classic sequence comparison metrics: \nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), \nto evaluate our reconstruction with respect to the real signature. In the following table, and we compare ouu method \nwith other methods present in the literature.\n\nFinally we proposed a new metric for clusters, the heart of our work, by defining the accuracy of the reconstructed\nclusters as the ratio of correctly reconstructed clusters to the number of all clusters. We talk about \nCluster Rebuilding Percentage (CRP).\nA correctly rebuilt cluster is a cluster for which all branches outgoing from it have been successfully \npaired (i.e. traversed in the direction in which the writer traced them).\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/zXxrb44/wor-result0.png\" alt=\"results\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Table. 1. Comparison with other methods. We have added also the CPR measure since\n the core of our work is the cluster analysis.</span>\n \n<br>\n\n</div>\n\nExperimentally, we have noticed that some signatures are more **difficult** than others. \nThis is mainly due to the fact that the writer could cross a line several times, making overlaps. \nWe therefore deemed it necessary to divide the dataset into three complexity classes (low, medium, high) \nand evaluate the results separately. We have defined complexity as a parameter that depends on the number of \nclusters and components in the signature: the more clusters and components there are in the signature, \nthe more difficult it is.\n\nThe good results obtained show that:\n- using an ideal skeletonization helps a lot, since there is no loss of information and a more in-depth analysis on \n  the signature can be conducted;\n\n- clusters of branch points give a lot of information on how a signature has been traced, allowing to correctly infer \n  the tracing direction. We have seen that the more clusters are reconstructed correctly the more likely the signature \n  is reconstructed correctly, so they are a key point for the writing order recovery task.\n\n- easy signatures, with few clusters and components, are almost always reconstructed in the right way.\n<br>\n\n## Conclusions\nThis work proposes a new approach based on pattern recognition for the execution of Writing Order Recovery, \nhighlighting through the good results obtained that:\n1. **the skeletonization phase must be greatly improved** to allow the subsequent phases to work on good quality data;\n\n2. **a good point and trace analysis performed locally may be sufficient** to estimate the writing order, without \n   resorting to computationally expensive algorithms that operate globally. <br></br>\n\nIn fact, the proposed algorithm works locally, compared to many algorithms, proposed in the literature, which \nwork considering the image as a whole. The latter, besides being more complicated and expensive, are also less \nreusable for different types of writing (for example oriental writing, Arabic writing, numbers).\n\nThe algorithm has several margins for improvement: in addition to refining the pattern detection metrics, it \ncould use other Machine Learning techniques such as the Kalman filter or more complex tracking clueing techniques \nto estimate the correct exit direction of a cluster.\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/a-novel-writing-order-recovery-approach-for-handwriting-specimens","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2022-04-17T15:05:11.484Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1650208034431},"$loki":2},{"slug":"improving-skeletonization-through-gans","description":"An innovative method for skeletonization concerns the use of GANs, to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches.","title":"<span>Improving Skeletonization through <strong>GANs</strong></span>","author":"Gioele Crispo","img":"improving-skeletonization-through-gans.jpeg","alt":"Android App with Kivy","tags":["deep-learning","computer-vision"],"createdAt":"2022-01-11T18:26:20.516Z","toc":[{"id":"introduction","depth":2,"text":"Introduction"},{"id":"why-skeletonization-is-so-important","depth":2,"text":"Why Skeletonization is so important"},{"id":"using-gans-to-transform-images","depth":2,"text":"Using GANs to transform images"},{"id":"results-and-improvement-points","depth":2,"text":"Results and Improvement points"},{"id":"performance","depth":3,"text":"Performance"},{"id":"conclusions","depth":2,"text":"Conclusions"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"improving-skeletonization-through-gans"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#improving-skeletonization-through-gans","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Improving Skeletonization through GANs"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Introduction"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Why Skeletonization is so important"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Using "},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"GANs"}]},{"type":"text","value":" to transform images"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Results and Improvement points"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Conclusions"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"introduction"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#introduction","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Introduction"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In recent months, I have begun to structure a new skeletonization method which,\nas you can understand from "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://gioelecrispo.github.io/blog/a-novel-writing-order-recovery-approach-for-handwriting-specimens","rel":["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],"target":"_blank"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"my previous article"}]},{"type":"text","value":",\nis the most delicate step of the "},{"type":"element","tag":"code","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"off2on"}]},{"type":"text","value":" framework, that means recovering an online handwriting\nfrom its offline counterpart.

It represents the starting point, such as a handwritten signature on a piece of \npaper. We start from the data collected electronically to have the ability to generate the image at the \ntop right, or our expected, through the Bresenham algorithm. In the lower left, there is the image showing \nthe result of a traditional skeletonization algorithm on the original image (i.e. the one in the upper \nleft). We can see that it is very far from the ideal. Finally, at the bottom right, is the result obtained \nwith a GAN trained on very few samples.\nIn this case, the result is not excellent, but it has captured features closer to the desired result.\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## Why Skeletonization is so important\nSkeletonization provides a compact yet effective representation of 2-D and 3-D objects, \nwhich is useful in many low- and high-level image-related tasks including object representation, \nretrieval, manipulation, matching, registration, tracking, recognition, and compression. \nAlso, it facilitates efficient characterization of topology, geometry, scale, and other related local \nproperties of an object.\n\nIn the field of handwriting recognition and signature verification, it plays an even more important role. \nThis has been abundantly underlined in the post [A novel Writing Order Recovery Approach for handwriting specimens](https://gioelecrispo.github.io/blog/a-novel-writing-order-recovery-approach-for-handwriting-specimens), \nin which I show that the writing order recognition algorithm I designed works well on the ideal \nskeleton. On a skeleton obtained with traditional skeletonisation methods, on the other hand, \nthe performance is significantly lower. This is due to the fact that current skeletonization algorithms \nproduce artifacts that tend to manipulate the image and hide precious details that would favor the \nrecovery of the writing trajectory.\n\nFurthermore, recovering the trajectory would be of fundamental importance for many other applications \nsuch as the study of the effects of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's on handwriting. Therefore, having \na performing skeletonization algorithm would allow to progress on the `off2on` framework studies and \nobtain important results on related applications.\nRefer to this [article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319443706_Recovering_Western_On-line_Signatures_From_Image-Based_Specimens)\nfor more details about the `off2on` framework and recovering strategies.\n\n<br/>\n\n## Using GANs to transform images\nStudying the Generative Adversarial Networks, I came across a particular type of these, \ncalled Pix2Pix, to carry out image transformation. The approach was presented by Phillip Isola, et al. \nin their 2016 paper, titled \n[“Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004)\nand presented at CVPR in 2017. \nIn particular, the aim was to obtain stylized images of Google maps from satellite ones.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/H79zxFm/pix2pix.png\" alt=\"results\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Fig. 2. Output described in the \"Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks\" paper, operating on satellite images.\n</span>\n\n<br>\n</div>\n\nThe GAN architecture is composed of a generator model, for creating new plausible synthetic images, and\na discriminator model, which classifies images as real or fake.\n\nThe Pix2Pix model is a type of conditional GAN, where the generation of the output image is\nconditional on an input, in this case, a source image. The discriminator is provided both with a source\nimage and the target image and must determine whether the target is a plausible transformation of the\nsource image.\n\n\nThe discriminator model weights are updated directly, whereas the generator model ones are updated\nvia the discriminator. In detail, the two models are trained simultaneously in an adversarial process\nwhere the generator tries to better fool the discriminator and the discriminator aims to better\nidentify the counterfeit images.\n\nThe generator is trained via adversarial loss, which encourages the generator to generate plausible \nimages in the target domain. The generator is also updated via L1 loss measured between the generated \nimage and the expected output image. This additional loss encourages the generator model to create \nplausible translations of the source image.\nThe generator is an encoder-decoder model using a U-Net architecture. It means that skip-connections \nare added between the encoding layers and the corresponding decoding layers, forming a U-shape.\nI recommend that you read the paper for an in-depth look at GANs and the type of architecture used.\n\n<br/>\n\nGiven the good results obtained in the paper, I decided to use the same architecture on a potentially \nsimpler task: **skeletonization**, which is still unsolved today.\n\nBelow, there are some sources I used to setup the project:\n - [How to develop a Pix2Pix GAN for image to image translation](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-pix2pix-gan-for-image-to-image-translation)\n - [GAN Pix2Pix generative model](https://towardsdatascience.com/gan-pix2pix-generative-model-c9bf5d691bac)\n\n<br/>\n\nThe idea is to use, as training set, images composed of the concatenation of a real handwritten \nimage and the skeletonized corrispective. As a skeletonized image, I used the one generated by the \nBresenham's algorithm, which for us is the ideal skeletonization.\n\nThe Pix2Pix GAN architecture proposed in the paper accepts only images of 256x256 pixels. I kept \nthis size with the purpose to be easier to train, in terms of number of samples and time.\nAs the GAN requires a fixed size input, the variability of the image size was \nmanaged by adding white padding and breaking the image into patches of 256x256 pixels. \nThe output is obtained by converting each patch individually and recomposing the image.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/3pYztZk/transform.png\" alt=\"transformation\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Fig. 3. An example of a signature larger than 256x256 pixels, \nto which padding has been added and split into patches of the required size. </span>\n\n<br>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n## Results and Improvement points\nI have trained the model for 100 epochs and with only 20 samples.\nThe goal was to conclude the tour to verify its feasibility and share these first results with \nthe University of Salerno to allow them to continue the experiments on the `off2on` framework.\n\nThis means that the model has a lot of room for improvement:\n- using a **larger dataset** will certainly allow for better results;\n- a **study on the hyperparameters** of the model must be carried out; in this regard it\n  is also important to define an optimization function, something not taken for granted on GANs;\n- thinking about the **modification of the architecture of the generator** model.\n\n<br/> \n\nAs you can see, in fact, the conversion is not perfect. Despite this, it can be noted that \nclusters/intersections are managed \"better\" than traditional skeletonizations. Refer to Fig 4. \nand focus on intersections,  where the `>--<` pattern, tipical of traditional skeletonization, \nis not created.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/KGLdmGQ/zoom.png\" alt=\"results\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Fig. 4. Comparison between traditional skeletonization (left) and\nGAN based one (right). It could be seen that the latter better identifies how the intersections\nhave to be drawn, though more training and post processing has to be done to get a clean result.</span>\n\n<br>\n\n</div>\n\nThere is a lot of work to do, both as regards the collection of new data to expand the dataset, \nand for the analysis of the best hyperparameters. Finally, a minimum of postprocessing \nis probably required.\nImage cleaning steps, such as erosion or dilation are needed and perhaps, a further \nskeletonization step with traditional approaches could be useful to obtain a clean result.\n\n\n### Performance\nTypically, GAN models do not converge; instead, an equilibrium is found between the generator \nand discriminator models. As such, we cannot easily judge when training should stop.\nThis evaluation can be done by eye, looking at the images produced by the generator model \nand determining if the result obtained is in line with the expected performance.\nIndeed, this is the method that was used to choose the best model on this small dataset.\n\nHowever, with specific reference to the skeletonization task, we can do better. For example, \nwe can define a performance evaluation function that returns a numerical value that indicates \nthe goodness of the transformation.\nThe proposal is to make a pixel-to-pixel subtraction of the generated image with respect to \nthe expected one and make the arithmetic average on all the generated-wait pairs of the test set.\nThe value obtained can give us a general idea of how the generator model is performing.\nAlso, the same function can be used to set up a hyperparameter optimization study.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/8KMH9G0/funzione-ottimiz.png\" alt=\"funz_ottimiz\" width=\"90%\"/>\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Fig. 5. A possible function to evaluate the GAN generation results \nand understand which of the many can be the best model. The evaluation function is simply represented \nby a pixel-to-pixel subtraction of the two images, the expected output and the generated one.</span>\n<br>\n</div>\n\n\n## Conclusions\nThis is just a first attempt, the result of training on only 20 samples for 100 epochs.\nAs he will know, GANs are not easy to train; they require time and some fine-tuning.\nSurely, one can do better with better datasets and hyperparameters.\nI shared my code with the University of Salerno, to continue with the experiments on `off2on`\nframeworks and improve this implementation.\nIn future, I hope to have the time to investigate the matter further \ntogether with the University.\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/improving-skeletonization-through-gans","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2022-04-17T15:05:11.484Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1650208034498},"$loki":3},{"slug":"making-an-app-with-kivy","description":"We tried to make an Android app with Kivy and we describe our experience, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the framework.","title":"<span>Making an app with <strong>Kivy</strong></span>","author":"Gioele Crispo, Stefania Avallone","img":"making-an-app-with-kivy.jpg","alt":"Android App with Kivy","tags":["android","python","devops"],"createdAt":"2022-02-16T13:15:20.516Z","toc":[{"id":"introduction","depth":2,"text":"Introduction"},{"id":"what-is-kivy","depth":2,"text":"What is Kivy"},{"id":"what-we-did-and-obtained","depth":2,"text":"What we did and obtained"},{"id":"building-an-android-package","depth":3,"text":"Building an Android package"},{"id":"ads-with-google-admob","depth":3,"text":"Ads with Google AdMob"},{"id":"kivy-benefits","depth":3,"text":"Kivy benefits"},{"id":"sounds","depth":3,"text":"Sounds"},{"id":"internationalization","depth":3,"text":"Internationalization"},{"id":"app-logic","depth":3,"text":"App logic"},{"id":"final-thoughts","depth":3,"text":"Final thoughts"},{"id":"kivys-pros-and-cons","depth":2,"text":"Kivy's Pros and Cons"},{"id":"conclusions","depth":2,"text":"Conclusions"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"making-an-app-with-kivy"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#making-an-app-with-kivy","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Making an App with Kivy"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Introduction"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What is Kivy"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What we did and obtained"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Kivy's "},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Pros"}]},{"type":"text","value":" and "},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Cons"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Conclusions"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"introduction"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#introduction","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Introduction"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Recently, I helped my girlfriend to make "},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Kaboo"}]}]},{"type":"text","value":", a word game in which multiple\nteams challenge each other at how many words they can guess.

Yes, it is very similar \nto the well known \"Taboo\", but it has nothing to do with it. The peculiarity is \nthat it is an Android app entirely developed in Python, through Kivy, a very \ninteresting multi-platform framework. This post tells about our experience in using \nthis framework, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses, in relation to our needs.\nIt is published on the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kames.kaboo&hl=en_US&gl=US\">Play Store</a> \n(give us good reviews! 😉) and below you will find a presentation video.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; width: 100%\">\n<iframe style=\"max-width:650px; height:auto;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qr9I3LjdkSw\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen>\n</iframe>\n\n<br></br>\n\n</div>\n\n<br/>\n\n## What is Kivy\nKivy is a multi-platform framework for building graphical user interfaces, in a simple and\nintuitive way using Python.\n\n<a href=\"https://kivy.org/#home\">Kivy's website</a> says it runs on Linux, Windows, OS X, Android, iOS, and Raspberry Pi, using \npretty much the same code. Natively supports most of the inputs, protocols and devices, \nincluding WM_Touch, WM_Pen, Mac OS X Trackpad eMagic Mouse, Mtdev, Linux Kernel HID, TUIO.\n\nThe framework immediately struck us because it is very promising, it has participated in \nseveral editions of the Google Summit of Code and above all it seems easy to use. \nIt's not difficult to find many examples of well-made apps online using Kivy, \nincluding an app to generate and edit PDFs and a Monopoly clone.\n\n<br/>\n\n## What we did and obtained\nWe chose to develop a game that was not in 3D, that did not require excessive logic and that\nwas completely offline to break down the complexity and focus on studying the framework. \nThe goal was to understand the potential of Kivy and quickly target the publication on the \nPlay Store.\nFor several reasons, we have decided to limit publication to the Google store only; we \nanticipate that the reasons are not related to money (Google 25 € once, Apple 100 € every \nyear), but depend on the compatibility of the framework and some tools we used.\n\nOne of the requirements we set ourselves was that the app has to be aesthetically pleasing and \nthat it has to be useful for bringing people together and making them feel good together after the\npandemic period. My girlfriend and I had a lot of fun on the phone trying to make each other\nguess words and we used this method to learn new languages as well. It seemed a good idea to \ndevelop this game that gave us joy and laughter and make it free in the \nPlay Store.\n\n### Building an Android package\nThe development of the app was not at all easy and brought more unexpected events, which \ncaused the publication to be postponed.\nAs a working method, we like to immediately understand if things are feasible and then \nthink about perfecting everything. So, right from the start we focused on understanding \nhow it was possible to build an Android app through Kivy.\nThere is a tool, called `Buildozer`, which promises builds on all mobile platforms via a handy \nconfiguration file, the `buildozer.spec`. In fact, it is a wrapper over the `python-for-android` \nand `kivy-ios` libraries, and aims to make them easier to use. Well, to our detriment, we \nhave found that things are never so simple. In fact, for the publication on the Play Store, \nfrom August 2021 the .aab format is required, which is not officially supported by\n`python-for-android`.\nThrough online research it emerged that the functionality has been implemented only in a\ndevelopment branch of `python-for-android`; therefore we had to make several changes to the\n`buildozer.spec` and various tests before getting a working build. For this we have to say \nthanks to so many people who have contributed on StackOverflow and Reddit and have helped us, \npiece by piece, to solve this complicated puzzle.\n\nFurthermore, buildozer only runs on Linux and, having only PCs with Windows available, we \nhad to set up docker and WSL to build an Android app and test the application on our \nsmartphones. This exploration and testing phase took a long time. Firstly, because the build \non WSL was very slow and the build process tainted the environment giving errors. The docker \nbuild on Windows is also slow, but it does allow us to have a repeatable process. We set up \na CI / CD pipeline that literally saved our lives. For this we have to say thanks to \n`ArtemSBulgakov` who made this [Action on GitHub](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/buildozer-action), \nwhich only supports Android. We don't know why, but the build on Github is much faster and \nin just 12 minutes it allows us to have an apk ready to be tested on our Android devices.\nThese activities took more than a month, counting that we could only work in certain windows \nof our free time.\n\n### Ads with Google AdMob\nAs a secondary requirement, we have decided to include advertising as well. It is not \ninvasive, the goal was to familiarize with the Google AdMob platform. To do this,\nwe have seen that the `Kivmob` [library](https://github.com/MichaelStott/KivMob) is simple \nand intuitive. It works as a wrapper on Android and iOS; however currently the methods are only \nimplemented for the Android interface.\nTo test the functioning of the library it was therefore necessary to be able to test on \nAndroid.\n\n\n### Kivy benefits\nWith these issues resolved, we focused on the development of the actual game. Regarding \nflexibility, extensibility and simplicity, Kivy has nothing to envy to more famous frameworks \nand we must admit that it surprised us a lot from these points of view.\nIn fact, it was quick and easy to set up our app pages. We had to explore the `kivy` and \n`kivymd` documentation a bit to understand how to use widgets and interact with core \nfeatures, but then the path was downhill. Building custom widgets isn't difficult at all, \nand the **KV language** works fairly well.\nCiting from its documentation:\n\n<p><i>The KV language, sometimes called kvlang or the kivy language, allows you to create your\nwidget tree in a declarative way and to bind widget properties to each other or to \ncallbacks in a natural manner. It allows for very fast prototypes and agile changes \nto your UI. It also facilitates separating the logic of your application and its User \nInterface.</i></p>\n\nWe can confirm that kv language is very powerful, allows hot-reloading and it \nsucceeds perfectly in its purposes. The result we got is the following:\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/74GM6RJ/kaboo.png\" alt=\"kaboo\" width=\"80%\"/> \n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Fig. 1. Screenshots of the main pages of the app.</i></a></span>\n<br>\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\nHowever, in other aspects Kivy is still a bit immature. Let's take audio as an example.\nA respectable game must have a good soundtrack and the ability to mute for anyone who \ndoesn't like it 😂.\n\n### Sounds\nKivy only offers a class called `SoundLoader`, which allows you to load an audio file and play \nit. Instead, a SoundManager is missing, which could manage all audio files together and \nimplement features such as muting all audio simultaneously.\nTo do this, therefore, we had to implement a rudimentary SoundManager and we built a wrapper \nover the SoundLoader class. We also noticed that loading audio files (and all resources in \ngeneral) blocks the main thread and causes a significant slowdown in loading performance.\nWe couldn't figure out how to avoid this behaviour and make the loading asynchronous or \npurely multithreaded. There is a library for asynchronous execution, named `asynckivy`, but \nwe don't know how to integrate it with resource loading. We are not framework experts\nand are probably ignoring something. Take a look at the [GitHub code](https://github.com/stefaniavallone/kaboo), \nand please tell us how to do it better.\n\n### Internationalization\nAnother thing we thought of doing was providing the app in English and in Italian, as well, \nto let our friends play, who, like us, are passionate about this game.\nWe have been looking for a long time how to introduce internationalization in Kivy. We \nfound that Python does not support it natively. You have to use a GNU tool called `xgettext` \n(and its python wrapper, `pygettext`) and then follow several manual steps before you can have \na working example. Furthermore, everything is complicated by the fact that the strings in\na Kivy app must be sensitive to language changes, without particular drawbacks.\nThere is no official documentation about it, but we found a \n[very interesting blog on internationalization in Python](https://phrase.com/blog/posts/translate-python-gnu-gettext/) \nand a [working example on Kivy](https://github.com/tito/kivy-gettext-example). \nThe latter was particularly illuminating; however, as described in its github repo, it only \nworks for strings in KV files and not for widgets that are created dynamically. \nFor these elements, such as Dialog and Modals, it is not possible to \"cache\" them, that is \nto create them once and show them only when needed, but it is necessary to completely recreate \nthe component, with performance drops.\n\n### App logic\nThe logic of the game is all in all simple and did not cause us any particular problems. We had\nto implement a shared status to be able to pass information from one screen to another in our Kivy app.\nWe were surprised that Kivy does not provide state management tools or libraries, such as \nRedux or Vuex, as in the case with modern JavaScript frameworks.\nThe version we have implemented is simple and suitable only for our purposes, it is by no \nmeans comparable to those provided by the JS counterpart.\n\n### Final thoughts\nFinally, the last part of the development was dedicated to improving the loading times of the assets. \nWe have achieved this by reducing the size of the files as much as possible, because we have already \nsaid we have not been able to parallelize or make the uploads asynchronous.\n\nIn conclusion, designing, implementing, packaging and optimizing this app took us about 2 and a half \nmonths, clearly working only in our free time (about 2 hours a day).\nAll in all, we have to say that it's a great result and Kivy is great for prototyping apps. \nSo many things remain unexplored: we have not included any features that directly use the smartphone \nhardware such as vibration or flashlight, however, there are examples on the internet and it seems \neasy to implement.\n\nIf today we were asked to implement a test app or a proof of concept, we will certainly evaluate the \nuse of Kivy, which can potentially run anywhere (even on Windows without emulators), but it is not \nand cannot be comparable to a native solution. \n\n<br/>\n\n## Kivy's Pros and Cons\nFor what we have done and how we have done it, we can say **Kivy is a great framework**, \nalthough it is still immature. In this section, we want to focus on its advantages and \ndisadvantages based on what our needs were.\nWe reiterate that we have developed a simple game, and the difficulties / facilities \nwe have found using this tool may not apply to other people developing different apps.\n\nIts main advantages are:\n- **it is based on Python**, which makes it simple and intuitive; after a little \n  time of learning the mechanics of the framework, it is easy to write the entire \n  software structure quickly.\n- **it is powerful and extensible**: through inheritance it is easy to extend or\n  customize widgets or build different behaviors to add to predefined widgets.\n- **it has great animation mechanism**: creating an animation in Kivy is very easy \n  and super intuitive; no ui framework we have tried allows the same flexibility;\n- **it is multi-platform**: with almost the same code it is possible to obtain the \n  same behavior on different platforms; this is a great plus, because it allows you to \n  prototype quickly and immediately start internal tests. However, cross-platform \n  solutions are rarely comparable to native solutions, both in terms of performance \n  and functionality, so we consider the reasoning valid only for prototypes.\n\n<br/>\n\nThe difficulties and shortcomings we have found are the following:\n- **lack of an _Audio Manager_**: Kivy only provides the SoundLoader interface, so we \n  had to build a rudimentary audio manager to mutate all the audio at the same time;\n- **lack of an _Internationalization Manager_**: Kivy does not provide an internationalization\n  mechanism (although this is a problem that affects more Python than the framework itself);\n- **lack of _Shared Status_**: Kivy does not appear to provide a precise guideline on \n  how to store and pass information from one screen to another. What we mean is the \n  lack of a \"Redux\" or \"Vuex\" type libraries or tools that you have in Angular / React \n  or Vuejs and derivatives. Sure, Python provides several ways to share information \n  between elements, but we wanted something more integrated with the framework. \n- **Not really fast**. To have a good loading performance it is necessary to sip every single \n  Kb from photos, videos and audio. We desired to have Kivy made it possible (or easier - \n  if you know how to do it) the simultaneous loading of multiple resources, without blocking \n  the main thread. Furthermore, on Android devices, to run Kivy it is needed to install a \n  complete Python distribution and executing python code that, as we know, is very slow.\n- **Not really ready to be cross-platform**. `buildozer` and `python-for-android `\n  do their job properly; it is not always easy to define the process to build an `apk` or\n  `aab`, but once set up, the process works correctly in almost all cases. However, the \n  result is not always the one expected: on some smartphones and tablets there are no display \n  problems, while on others a white box appears at the top of the screen. It is clearly a\n  problem due to resizing, in fact after a reload of the ui, the app is rendered \n  correctly (Fig. 3). However, on all devices there are some graphical glitches in the loading \n  phase (Fig. 2). Perhaps, they are due to the fact that we are using a dev branch of `python-for-android`,\n  but it is unfortunately necessary to allow the production of a package in `.aab` format, \n  as discussed above.\n\n<br/>\n<div class='row' style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<div class='column'>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/svyHj1Q/glitches.gif\" alt=\"skeletonization\" width=\"50%\"/> \n\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;  margin: 10px;\">Fig.2.

There are several \nthings that should be perfected and others that should be natively endured.\n\nAll these aspects have been partially overcome with workarounds found online or by skipping \nthe problem for the moment.\n\nSurely, most of the drawbacks we encountered in the development of this application are due \nto the fact that we do not have a thorough knowledge of the framework.

It's a process that helps organizations and business leaders generate long-term value\nand reduce risk associated with data science, machine learning, and AI initiatives.\n\nThis post intends to highlight the challenges that MLOps solves and give a practical cut with an open-source tool: \n**MLFlow**.\n\n<br>\n\nThere are several key points in the challenges that MLOps tries to solve:\n1. **There are many dependencies**. Not only data, but also business needs are constantly changing. This means that a\n   machine learning application must be designed to be able to adapt to changes.\n\n2. **Data scientists are not engineers**. The figure of the data scientist is strongly projected on the analysis of \n   data and on the proposition of valid solutions to the problem. Often, other figures are needed for the optimization \n   of internal processes (data collection, performance, code reuse, etc.) and integration with other software components.\n\n3. **Standardize the development-deployment process**. The packaging of complex application requires the intervention \n   of different thematic areas and with different skills. MLOps standardizes the process, allowing all teams to easily \n   access resources and manage the life cycle of ML capabilities.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/M1BH6Lz/mlops-phases.png\" alt=\"ml-phases\" width=\"85%\"/> \n\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;white-space: pre-wrap\">Fig. 1. The life cycle of a machine learning application. There are six stages: PLAN, BUILD, TEST, DEPLOY, MONITOR and FEEDBACK.\nIt is a cyclical process that involves different teams and requires different skills.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n</div>\n\nGiven the great challenges that a Machine Learning application brings with it, it becomes essential to automate and \nrationalize the development and deployment processes. \nIn fact, when we talk about machine learning applications, we must always consider that they are complex applications, \nintegrated with several other systems; that they have to handle large amounts of data and traffic volumes; and that \nthe inputs of such applications are not only the application rules, but also the data.\nThe proven DevOps tools come to the rescue: this is how MLOps was born. Although introducing MLOps processes has a \ncost, there are very few cases in which MLOps is not useful; \nthe saving of money and time almost always justifies its use.\n\n\n## Risk assessment and advantages\nThe risks of a Machine Learning application are many and MLOps is a way, derived from the methodologies born of \nclassic applications, to mitigate them.\nTherefore, when looking at MLOps as a way to mitigate risk, an analysis should cover:\n+ The risk that the model is unavailable for a given period of time\n+ The risk that the model returns a bad prediction for a given sample\n+ The risk that the model accuracy or fairness decreases over time\n+ The risk that the skills necessary to maintain the model (i.e., data science talent) are lost\n\n<br>\nRisks are usually larger for models that are deployed widely and used outside of the organization. \nRisk assessment is generally based on two metrics: the probability and the impact of the adverse event.\nRisk assessment should be performed at the beginning of each project and reassessed periodically, as models may be \nused in ways that were not foreseen initially.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/HKLvVR7/risk-matrix.png\" alt=\"risk-matrix\" width=\"80%\"/> \n\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;white-space: pre-wrap\">Fig. 2. The risk matrix is fundamental to understand how critical are some requirements and so how important is addressing them with MLOps.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n</div>\n\n\nGood MLOps practices will help teams at a minimum:\n+ Keep track of versioning, especially with experiments in the design phase\n+ Understand whether retrained models are better than the previous versions (and promoting models to production that \n  are performing better)\n+ Ensure (at defined periods—daily, monthly, etc.) that model performance is not degrading in production\n\n<br>\n\n## People of MLOps\nSince an application that includes machine learning models is very complex, different professionals are involved:\n+ **Subject Matter Expert**. is the figure who guides the entire process, defining the needs and business metrics \n  for which a Machine Learning application must be developed. It acts in the feedback part, so it is very important \n  that the MLOps techniques allow to extract the performance of the model also in terms of business metrics. \n  The transformations that are carried out on the data must also be made known and easy to understand. Finally, for \n  the Subject Matter Expert, MLOps could be useful both for *Data Explainabily* and for *Regulatory compliance*.\n\n+ **Data Scientist**. The Data Scientist is a very important figure in the process. You interface with the Subject \n  Matter Expert to translate the problem and business metrics into a machine learning problem and metrics. Furthermore, \n  they have the arduous task of defining, understanding and finding the best settings and models for that particular \n  problem. This can take some time and be very complicated in the case of poorly defined problems or very large \n  applications. MLOps helps you easily monitor models in production models to guide choice in A / B testing. Plus, \n  improve efficiency with automated model packing and deployment.\n\n+ **Data Engineers**. In a machine learning process, data is the central part. Likewise, the role of data engineers \n  is primary: they must obtain data from external sources, process it, standardize it and prepare it for algorithm \n  training. They must interface with Subject Matter Experts to understand what types of data they need and with Data \n  Scientists to adjust data processing according to their needs. Being a very onerous and full-time activity for \n  large companies, Data engineers can greatly benefit from MLOps Pipelines, managing to guarantee a clean, organized \n  and well-engineered data transformation process.\n\n+ **Software Engineers**. Software engineers are equally important figures from a strategic point of view for the \n  company. In fact, machine learning applications are experiments for their own sake, but they integrate into larger \n  applications that involve different aspects and businesses of the company. In addition to integration, they take \n  care of automatic testing and versioning, in order to have the CI / CD pipelines under control.\n\n+ **DevOps team**. The DevOps team has two important roles. The first is to ensure the correct functioning in terms of \n  reliability, performance, security and availability of resources and Machine Learning models with tests and \n  operations processes. Second, they are responsible for managing the CI / CD pipeline. To do this correctly \n  they must interface with Data Engineers, Software engineers and Data Scientists.\n\n+ **Model Risk Manager/Auditor**. Model risk auditors are an essential figure especially in some critical sectors, \n  such as financial or medical, where there are some constraints on regulatory compliance. They play a fundamental \n  role both in defining business metrics, guiding operational research on performance and the type of machine models, \n  and in monitoring and testing the model in production.\n  MLOps processes allow these figures to be able to intervene rigorously when internal and external requirements are \n  not met.\n \n+ **Machine Learning Architect**. Machine learning architects are increasingly important figures for Machine \n  Learning applications. They need to know how the data will be used and consumed in order to optimize the software \n  architecture to improve performance in terms of speed and accuracy of predictions.\n  Not only are they focused on data, they also need to have the right expertise to introduce new or more advanced \n  technologies to optimize predictive models when needed. This implies that they must be aware of all the steps of \n  the pipeline and have an overview of the shared resources in order to propose, together with the team of DevOps \n  and software engineers, architectural solutions suitable for the business problem.\n\n<br>\n\n## Levels of automation\nAfter understanding the complexity of ML applications, the professionals involved and the advantages of MLOps, let's \nbriefly illustrate the concept of pipeline, derived from DevOps principles.\nA **_Pipeline_** is divided into distinct subsets of activities, aimed to simplify and standardize the development \nand distribution of a software. Each of them constitutes a phase of the pipeline. \nTypical pipeline stages include:\n+ **Build**: the phase of the application in which the source code is compiled.\n+ **Test**: the stage where the code is tested. The automation allows you to save time and effort.\n+ **Release**: the stage where the application is delivered to the repository.\n+ **Deployment**: at this stage the code is deployed to the production department.\n+ **Validation and Compliance**: The steps to validate a build typically depend on the needs of the organization. \n\n<br>\n\nIn the context of the MLOps the stages changes a bit, related more to the Machine Learning steps. For example, in a \npipeline for a machine learning model creation, we have: \n**Data preprocessing**, **Model Selection**, **Training model**, **Model Evaluation**, **Model Validation** and\n**Model Summary**. \n\nBased on the stages defined and implemented, we can identify 3 levels of automation:\n- **Manual Implementation**. \n- **Continuous Model Delivery**.\n- **Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery of pipelines**.\n\n<br>\n\n### Manual Implementation\nIn this setup, everything is handled manually, without any pipeline and automation technique. This means that data \nscientists, data engineers and machine learning engineers manually carry out the phase of data analysis and \nprocessing, feature extraction, model choice, training, testing, validation.\nOnce these activities have been completed, they must manually package the model in a structure that can be used and \ninterfaced with other components and put it in a code repository.\nSoftware engineers must take the model from the code repository and manually integrate it into the application. \nFinally, the devops team is left with the task of monitoring the application in functional and performance terms.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Tv42V3x/mlops-manual-implementation.png\" alt=\"risk-matrix\" width=\"95%\"/> \n\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;white-space: pre-wrap\">Fig. 3. The setup with no automation strategies.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n</div>\n\nAll figures are involved and with the burden of doing everything manually. This implies that the setup is not \nresilient to changes in data and business needs: it is necessary to carry out the analysis, training, testing, \nintegration and deployment manually.\n\n<br>\n\n### Continuous Model Delivery\n\nThis setup includes very important elements:\n1. the **Feature Store**, which is a data storage for training data accessible to all teams and contains the data \n   already cleaned and preprocessed. At this juncture, we are talking about basic preprocessing, such as resizing \n   images to the same resolution, normalizing units of measurement or creating data generators and batches.\n\n2. **Automated Model Building and Analysis**, which is an engineering of the model building phase, allowing \n   Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers to rely on automatic data preprocessing procedures, model selection, \n   training, hyperparameter testing, validation and optimization.\n   The preprocessing here refers to the adjustments on the data needed to be used by the model. The output of this \n   process is a **Modularized code**, that is a well-engineered code that encapsulates a generic model and provides \n   simple and model-independent interfaces. This allows you to standardize and automate the next steps, i.e. integration \n   tests, deploy, etc.\n\n3. The **Deploy Pipeline**, which is a pipeline designed to put the model into production. The pipeline \n   starts from the modularized code, seen in the previous point, and carries out some preparatory steps before putting \n   the **Automated Training pipeline** into operation, which will produce a working model that can be used in production.\n\n4. The **Automated Training pipeline**, which is a pipeline that handles model training and produces a working \n   trained model ready for production. The final model is placed in a **Model Registry**. The Automated Training \n   pipeline is launched from the **Deploy Pipeline** or a **Trigger** and interfaces with the **Feature Store** to get \n   the data that will be used for training. The trigger can be enabled manually or it can be enabled automatically by \n   events such as the change of distribution in the data collected by monitoring the model in production.\n\n5. The **Model Registry**, which is a container of trained models, accessible by all project teams. The Model \n   Registry allows you to keep track of the various models produced, versioning them and allowing a quick comparison of \n   their performance, discriminating the best and allowing you to automatically choose the best performing model.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/6HvpGKQ/mlops-cmd.png\" alt=\"risk-matrix\" width=\"95%\"/> \n\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;white-space: pre-wrap\">Fig. 4. The setup with Continuous Model Delivery.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n</div>\n\nWith this process setting, all professional figures have control over what is happening, being able to monitor \nperformance in a deterministic and automatic way; the greater effort on the engineering part of the code and the \ntraining and deployment pipelines reward with the creation of a more stable and faster process, capable of \nwithstanding frequent changes on requirements or data.\nHowever, you can do better by automating the testing part of the pipelines as well. In fact, there are no \nmechanisms for testing and debugging pipelines automatically, and it must be done manually before it is sent \nto the code repository. This can become problematic and burdensome especially when there are multiple models \nand different architectures with different ways of data preprocessing, training and testing. Letting testing \nand debugging manually can become a bottleneck and be risky.\nAlso, pipelines are not automatically deployed. This implies that if the structure in the code changes, engineers \nmust rebuild parts of the application to make it compatible with the new pipeline and its modularized code. \nModularization, in fact, only works without problems when all components know what to expect from each other; \nas soon as one of the components is no longer compatible, the application must be rebuilt to accommodate the \nnew changes or the component must be rewritten to work with the original pipeline.\n\n<br>\n\n### Continuous integration / Continuous delivery of pipelines\n\nThis setup introduces other improvements:\n1. **Testing**, to be able to automatically test code building pipelines and package only those pipelines that \n   pass the tests. The tests, at this juncture, could be related to the verification of the inputs and outputs of \n   the pipeline, of the ranges of the hyperparameters, if the scaling or normalizations on the data have occurred \n   correctly (both in preprocessing and in postprocessing), etc. Therefore this phase is fundamental in order to \n   deliver complete and correct pipelines in the ** Package Store ** that can also be reused on different domains \n   and with very different neural network architecture.\n\n2. The **Package Store** is a pipeline container. It is optional but included in this configuration so that \n   there is a centralized area where all teams can access packaged pipelines ready for deployment. The model development \n   teams push in this package repository and software engineers and DevOps teams can retrieve a packaged pipeline \n   and deploy it. It works in a very similar way to the **Model Registry** as both elements help to achieve \n   continuous delivery.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/BZPsZ20/mlops-ci-cmd.png\" alt=\"risk-matrix\" width=\"95%\"/> \n\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;white-space: pre-wrap\">Fig. 5. The setup with Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery of pipelines.</p>\n\n<br>\n</div>\n\nThis is the most complete setup that allows you to absorb even important changes on specifications and data. \nIt is a completely generic setup that can also be reused for other projects or products and therefore it is worth \nspending some resources to set up this mechanism.\n\n<br>\n\n## A tool for MLOps: MLFLow\nAfter having seen the key aspects of the MLOps processes, let's try to give a practical footprint.\nMLFlow is an open-source tool, easy to integrate in your existent machine learning processes.\nOnly few lines of code are needed to track all of the metrics you need. Furthermore, MLFlow saves the models, \nallowing for future use in deployment or model serving functionality in a simple manner. You can also compare \nall of the metrics between the individual models to select the best one. \nMLFlow also integrates into Databricks, AWS SageMaker, Microsoft Azure, and can be deployed to Google Cloud as well, \nall of which are tools that help manage your MLOps setup and serve as platforms to deploy your models on. \nWhile the cloud platforms do provide some MLOps functionality, with the extent of this varying for each platform,\nthe advantage of using MLFlow is that it lets you have the freedom of choice when it comes to one platform to \ncommit to.\n\nSo, the main benefit of using MLFlow is that, for free, you can start managing your machine learning experiments \nlocally and translate everything to the cloud with minimal effort. This is useful both for the data scientist \nwho works independently and for small to medium-sized companies with a limited budget.\n\n\nOne of the best features of MLFlow is that the automatic management of **modularization** we have seen previously. \nThis allows you to manage very different models equally, even belonging to different libraries such as Tensorflow, \nPyTorch, Scikit-learn or PySpark. In fact, MLFlow creates a sort of wrapper around the model in order to standardize \nthe user experience in the deployment and prediction phase: to use it, simply transform the data into a certain \nformat and execute REST calls on the endpoint provided by MLFlow. The latter in fact also allows the deployment \nof a model save with a simple API.\n\nIn general, MLFlow has several features that support the life cycle of a machine learning application:\n\n+ **Creating experiments**: Experiments in MLFlow allow you to group your models and any\n  relevant metrics. This is important, for example, for comparing the same model with different dataset or\n  for comparing models from different libraries, such as Tensorflow or PyTorch to see which one is more performing.\n\n+ **Model and metric logging**: MLFlow allows you to save a model in a modularized form and log all of\n  the metrics related to the model run. A model run is a composed of several steps (usually model training, testing \n  and validation), in which you can write custom code. \n  You can mark the start and the end of each run and decide which metrics you want to log. \n  Additionally, you can save images, graphs, plots (such as confusion matrices and ROC curves) for a successive \n  comparison. \n\n+ **Comparing model metrics**: With an easy to use web interface, MLFlow allows you to compare different models,\n  settings and their metrics all at once also in a singular experiment. This could be very useful when performing \n  validation to tune a model’s hyperparameters. In a moment, you can compare all of the selected metrics and choose \n  the best.\n\n+ **Model Registry**: MLFlow implements a model registry functionality, helping to define what stage a \n  particular model is in. T o make the most of the feature, you  have to integrate it with other platforms which \n  provide built-in model registry feature, such as Databricks.\n\n+ **Local deployment**: MLFlow allows you to deploy on a local server by exposing an endpoint on which doing \n  REST call. This permits to easily test model inference. Data is sent to the model in one of several standardized \n  formats and it returns the predictions made by the model. Such a setup can easily be converted to work on a \n  hosted server or cloud-provided server as well. The only difference comes with where you host the model and \n  the particular procedure for querying it.\n\n\nI will not go into the merits of integrating MLFlow into existing code; the purpose of this post is not to be a \npractical guide. Software tends to change over time, and it would no longer be a general post. For information, \nyou can refer to the <a href=\"https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html\">MLFlow documentation</a> which will \nbe increasingly updated and more reliable than this post. \nThe intent is to show that there is the possibility of using automation and monitoring tools locally, with \nminimal costs and enormous advantages.\n\n<br>\n\n## Conclusions\nDevOps techniques were born to make the development and distribution of classic applications more efficient and \norganized. The automation of these processes is a fundamental step to face the complexity of these applications, \nwhich is constantly growing. In fact, they often provide different levels of persistence, integration with other \nsystems, an ever-increasing number of microservices, API Gateways, unified identity providers for multiple \napplications, etc.\nThe MLOps techniques have been derived from the former and specifically aimed at applications that include \nMachine Learning models. Such applications hide more challenges and pitfalls than traditional applications. \nThis is because ML models require more resources and are dependent on two inputs: business rules and **data**. \nData is a very important part of the process and, just like business needs, they are constantly changing.\n\nFurthermore, it should be remembered that machine learning applications do not live alone, but are always an \nintegral part of traditional applications, which makes the entire application difficult to manage without \nautomation and pipeline techniques.\n\nPrecisely for this reason, many people with different skills and responsibilities are involved in the development \nprocess of an ML application: Subject matter experts, Data Scientists, AI and data engineers, Software Architects, \nDevOps Engineer and Model risk managers/auditors.\nTools such as the model registry and a shared data/feature store allow all teams in the game to be aligned and \nable to discern the version of the model in production, making the development and distribution chain accessible \nto all.\n\nAs the last step of this post, we took a look at MLFlow. It is an open-source tool that can be used locally to test \nparts of pipelines, organize work and code to support monitoring and automated model deployment at no cost. \nWith the wrappers towards Databricks, AWS SageMaker and Azure Machine Learning it is immediate to translate to cloud \nprocesses and architectures.\n","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/mitigate-risk-and-enhance-productivity-with-mlops","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2022-04-17T15:05:11.488Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1650208034716},"$loki":5},{"slug":"s-o-l-i-d-rules-to-build-a-solid-software-architecture","description":"S.O.L.I.D. principles and their consequences are analyzed in depth.","title":"<span><strong>S.O.L.I.D.</strong> rules to build a <strong>solid</strong> software architecture</span>","author":"Gioele Crispo","img":"s-o-l-i-d-rules-to-build-a-solid-software-architecture.png","alt":"solid rules","tags":["architectures"],"createdAt":"2020-11-11T12:15:20.516Z","toc":[{"id":"introduction","depth":2,"text":"Introduction"},{"id":"what-is-a-software-architecture","depth":2,"text":"What is a \"Software Architecture\"?"},{"id":"solid-principles","depth":2,"text":"S.O.L.I.D. principles"},{"id":"component-cohesion-principles","depth":2,"text":"Component cohesion principles"},{"id":"component-coupling-principles","depth":2,"text":"Component coupling principles"},{"id":"conclusions","depth":2,"text":"Conclusions"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h1","props":{"id":"solid-principles-to-build-a-solid-software-architecture"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#solid-principles-to-build-a-solid-software-architecture","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"S.O.L.I.D. principles to build a solid software architecture"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Introduction"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What is a \""},{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Software Architecture"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\"?"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"S.O.L.I.D. principles"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Component cohesion principles"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Component coupling principles"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Conclusions"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"introduction"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#introduction","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Introduction"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This article is highly inspired by the work of Robert C.

Martin, popularly known as Uncle Bob, in its book \"*Clean Architecture*\".\nS.O.L.I.D., in fact, is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design principles defined by Uncle Bob, \ntogether with the principles of component cohesion e component coupling.\nThese principles are fundamental for building high quality software architectures.\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:25px; border-left: 4px solid #666; padding-left:15px\">\n<i>But why do we have to design good software architectures and not package software that just works?</i>\n</p>\n\nIt sounds like a rhetorical question, but there is much more to it. A well-designed architecture means making the system resilient to changes and benefit a lot in terms of costs.\nIt might appear that this problem only affects long-running projects, but it doesn't - customers are constantly asking for software changes based on marketing choices or what they have seen so far.\nAgile methods were born to have software development processes that are less rigid, faster and better absorb the changes required by the customer, but they cannot absorb the costs in terms of development time if the architecture behind them is not of good quality.\nBefore going into the details of the basic principles for the design of a good architecture we need to \ndefine it and understand the disadvantages of not having one.\n\n<br/>\n\n## What is a \"*Software Architecture*\"?\nIn his book, Robert C. Martin defines software architecture like this:\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:25px; border-left: 4px solid #666; padding-left:15px\">\n<i>The architecture of a software system is the \"form\" given to that system by those who build it. \n   By \"form\" we mean the division of this system into components, in the arrangement of them and \n   in the ways in which these components communicate with each other. \n   The purpose is to facilitate the development, distribution, operation and maintenance of the \n   software system contained therein.</i>\n</p>\n\n\n\nAmong the various definitions, in my opinion, Uncle Bob's is the most effective. \nIt clearly defines the ultimate goal of a software architecture: **to support the life cycle of \nthe system, minimizing the costs of its implementation and maximizing the programmer's productivity.**\n\nNot having a good architecture implies that the system produced will be of poor quality:\n+ will have **poor maintainability**: a trivial change can impact many files and lines of code with the possibility \n  of multiplying bugs;\n+ it will be **difficult to understand**: the understanding of the software suffers considerably; those who join the \n  team after the project or the developer himself after months makes a lot of effort to understand the code.\n+ will enjoy **poor reusability**: it means having large blocks of code and duplicated functionality in the project.\n+ will be **hardly testable**: having large components, not logically separate and inter-dependent on each other, \n  makes it very difficult to produce good test suites.\n\n<br/>\n\n## S.O.L.I.D. principles\nFollowing there are the principles:\n\n+ **Single-responsibility Principle (SRP)**: \n  A class or a module should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job. \n\n<br/>\n\nThis principle indicates that everything that the same reason or actor to change must be cohesive, put together, \nand separated from the pieces of code that can change for different reasons or actors.\n\n<br/>\n\n+ **Open-closed Principle (OCP)**:\n  Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n\n<br/>\n\nTo ensure good maintainability the system should be open to extensions rather than modifications. \nThis is important to maintain consistency with the other parts that the part of the software \ninterfaces with. Allowing extensions means taking advantage of inheritance at the class level \nand building extensible components at the architecture level.\n\n<br/>\n\n\n+ **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** :\n  Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. \n  Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.\n\n<br/>\n\nLiskov's principle tells us how to control inheritance. But it can be transported to the architectural level by \nindicating how components must communicate with each other, through a strong definition of interfaces.\n\n<br/>\n\n+ **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:\n  A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n\n<br/>\n\nThis principle simply tells us to make classes and modules simple, avoiding unnecessary dependencies \nand therefore difficult to maintain in the long term.\n\n<br/>\n\n+ **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:\n  Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. \n  It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.\n\n<br/>\n\nThis principle tells us that dependencies should all refer to abstract components and not to concrete \ncomponents. The use of concrete classes is advisable only when they are extremely **stable**, \nthat is, little prone to changes. Think of the *String* class: you are sure that it will never or almost never \nchange and you can use it with confidence.\n\n<br/>\n\n## Component cohesion principles\nFirst of all, we need to establish the definition of component that we are going to use. \nA component is a unit of composition with a given context and that can be deployed independently \nsuch as .jar or a npm module. \n\n+ **Reuse/Release equivalence Principle (REP)**:\n  The granularity of reuse is the granularity of release. \n\n<br/>\n\nBasically, it means that a component should be released as highly cohesive code units, so the elements of it would be releasable together.\nClasses and modules that have been bundled together in a component should be releasable together. The fact that they share the same version number and release code and are included in the same release documentation must be logically acceptable to the author of the component and should make sense to the user. \nA user could decide whether to use the component or its new dressing based on the documentation that is provided.\n\n<br/>\n\n+ **Common Closure Principle (CCP)**\n  We keep together in a component all the classes that are modified for the same reason and at the same time. \n\n<br/>\n\nIt is a component version of the Single Responsibility Principle. While the latter states that a *class* should have only one \nsingle reason to be modified, CCP tell us a *component* should not have more than one reason to change.\nThat way, we increase the maintainability of our software by having to alter just a component when the requirement specific to it changes.\nFurthermore, this principle is strongly related to the OCP principle: they refer to the same \"closure\" meaning. The classes\nshould be closed to changes but open to the extensions. Since a perfect closure (the immutability of the code) is impossible,\nwe have to reduce the changes by adopting the strategy to put all together the classes which are correlated each one.\n\nWe can summarize the CCP and SRP principles in the following statement: \n***\"Gather together those things that change simultaneously and for the same reasons.\"***\n\n<br/>\n\n+ **Common Reuse Principle (CRP)**:\n  We shouldn’t force our users to depend on things that they are not going to use.\n\n<br/>\n\nIt helps us to choose which classes and module we have to put together into a component.\nThis principle tell us also what not to do. this principle also tells us what not to do. \nIf the user component uses only one component class and not the others, you will still need to import and depend on the whole component. \nThis becomes a problem, because the user component may undergo changes (and will have to be recompiled, rebuilt and redistributed anyway) \neven if the changes affect classes that the user component does not use. We must therefore always analyze the dependencies and make sure \nthat the modules to be included in a component are really inseparable.\nThe CRP principle is the generic version of the ISP principle, which urges us not to depend on classes containing methods we don't use.\n\nWe can summarize the CPR and ISP principles in the following statement: \n***\"Don't depend on the things you don't need.\"***\n\n<br/>\n\n## Component coupling principles\nOnce we know how create components, we have also to put the attention on how the interact each other. \nThe next principles regards the components relationship. \n\n+ **Acyclic Dependencies Principle (ADP)**:\n  Do not allow loops to arise in the dependency graph between components.\n\n<br/>\n\nAccording to this principle, we must divide the components according to their relationships \navoiding that one component depends on another that depends directly or indirectly on the first. \nFurthermore, the components should be independently developed and released. \nThis implies that a component dependent on a certain other component or module is not forced to modify \nits code based on the changes of that module on which it depends and can use the previous version \nuntil it is not ready to change.\n\n<br/>\n\n+ **Stable Dependencies Principle (SDP)**:\n  Bet on stability.\n\n<br/>\n\nThe stability of a component is measured based on its inbound and outbound dependencies. \nIf a component depends on many other components (incoming dependencies) it has many reasons to \nchange and be modified according to the changes imposed by the components it depends on.\nIf a component is a dependency of many other components (outbound dependencies) it has many \nreasons to **NOT** change and be modified in order not to impact the components that depend on it.\nSo a component is stable if it has many dependencies on exit and few on input.\n\n<br/>\n\n+ **Stable Abstraction Principle (SAP)**:\n  A component should be as abstract as it is stable.\n\n<br/>\n\nIn the stable components we must therefore insert what must change little, that is, the \"political\" \ndecisions to orient the system, which must not be **volatile**, however they must be **flexible**.\nThe best way is to use abstract classes, because they \nguarantee us an easy modifiability through extension (OCP principle).\n\n<br/>\n\n## Conclusions\nHaving these principles in mind is certainly an extra weapon to produce quality software, \nmaximizing the time and effort of those who work on it. Basically, the principles all aim to isolate \nsoftware, avoiding creating unnecessary and harmful dependencies for system maintenance. The *software* \nis by definition changeable; therefore it is necessary to be as lean and flexible as possible. \nHowever, too much generalization can also be harmful if it is not used correctly or is not necessary \nin relation to the domain of the system: it is a waste of resources and time.
