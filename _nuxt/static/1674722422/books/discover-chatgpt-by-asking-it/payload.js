It is a \u003Cb\u003Etechnical experiment\u003C\u002Fb\u003E, as I aim to evaluate whether a neural network (ChatGPT) is capable of writing an entire book and how much human intervention is required to produce a readable and enjoyable final product. It is also an experiment in empathy and the ability of ChatGPT to convey emotions through its writing.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this work is also a \u003Cb\u003Esocial experiment\u003C\u002Fb\u003E, as I seek to gauge the level of interest in reading an \"autobiographical\" work written by a machine. I am curious to see how people respond to this unique and groundbreaking work, and I hope that it sparks discussions and debates about the role and potential of artificial intelligence in society.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscover more about my projects at \u003Ca href='https:\u002F\u002Fgioelecrispo.github.io'\u003Ehttps:\u002F\u002Fgioelecrispo.github.io\u002F\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",ebook:{price:"€ 5,00",purchaseLink:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.it\u002Fdp\u002FB0BT25N51X"},paperback:{price:a,purchaseLink:b},hardcover:{price:a,purchaseLink:b}}}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}("€ 16,90","")));
